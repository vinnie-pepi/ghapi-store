<h1>Simple Templating</h1>
<p>This is a sample template that was generated for you and pushed to our github repo. You can access and edit this template here:

<h4>
  A quick intro to creating your template:
</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Add some sample json data to the sample data folder here: [ link to sample data ]</li>
  <li>
    Sample data can be accessed within your template by using the handlebars templating system: 
    <br />
    <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank">http://handlebarsjs.com/</a>
    <p>
    You can think of the sample data as your context in handlebars so for example, the sample form below uses the following sample data:
    </p>
      <pre>
        {
          "name": "Factual Shanghai Office",
          "address": "166 Kaixuan Road Suite 101, Building 1",
          "open": "YES",
          "type": "office",
          "number": "123456",
          "notes": "hello world!"
        }
      </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Build your form using html and data from your sample to however you like it.
    (<a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com">Jquery</a> included)
  </li>
  <li>Gather any inputs you like from the worker. What you name your inputs will be how they are stored in mastermind and how you will access them later. 
If a worker comes back to this template, the inputs that he or she had previously saved will be populated so there is no need to set a value on a text input or set checked on a radio or a checkbox.
The submit buttons will also be created for you.
